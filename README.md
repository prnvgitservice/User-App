# MyApp — Build & Release Guide

This guide shows how to build the app locally (APK) and prepare/upload to Google Play using EAS (Expo Application Services). The project targets Expo SDK 54.

## What I changed
- Added `sdkVersion: "54.0.0"` to `app.json`.
- Added `eas` build scripts to `package.json`.
- Added this README with step-by-step instructions.

## Requirements
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Expo CLI (optional for dev): `npm install -g expo-cli`
- EAS CLI (for builds): `npm install -g eas-cli`
- Java JDK 11 (for local builds)
- Android SDK + Android Studio (for local signing/building)
- An Expo account (for EAS build IDs)

## Useful folders to add (optional)
- `android/` and `ios/` — generated by `expo prebuild` (only if you need to run native projects locally or modify native code).
- `build/` — local output folder you can create to collect generated artifacts.

## Quick local APK build (recommended flow)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Login to EAS: `eas login`
3. Configure credentials: `eas credentials` or follow prompts during `eas build`.
4. To generate a local APK (uses EAS local builds):
   - Run `npm run prebuild` to generate native projects (creates `android/` and `ios/` folders).
   - Run `npm run build:local:apk` to start a local EAS build for APK.

Notes: Building locally requires a working Android toolchain (Java, Android SDK, Gradle). For faster cloud builds, use `npm run eas:build:apk` or `npm run eas:build:android` which run on EAS servers.

## Publish to Play Store (recommended via EAS)
1. Ensure `eas.json` is configured (already present). Check `expo.extra.eas.projectId` in `app.json`.
2. Run `npm run eas:build:android` to produce an AAB / app-bundle.
3. When build completes, use `eas submit -p android --path <path-to-aab>` or use Play Console to upload the AAB.

## Notes & Next steps
- If you need me to also update native Android `gradle` or other platform-specific files, tell me and I'll make minimal, safe edits.
- I did not change your source logic—only config and scripts to enable SDK 54 and EAS builds.

## Troubleshooting
- If the build fails due to native dependency versions, run `expo prebuild` and fix the generated `android/build.gradle` errors or ask me to adjust specific native libs.

---
If you want, I can also:
- Update dependency versions to ones verified for SDK 54.
- Run a local prebuild and attempt a local APK build (requires Android toolchain installed on your machine).
- Prepare Play Store metadata (fastlane/eas submit automation).
